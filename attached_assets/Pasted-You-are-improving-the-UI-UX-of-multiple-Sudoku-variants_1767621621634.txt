You are improving the UI/UX of multiple Sudoku variants in a Sudoku web application. The goal is to enhance visual clarity, distinguishability, and gameplay readability while keeping the design clean and modern.

1️⃣ Standard Sudoku (9×9) – Grid Line Refinement

Current issue:

Every 3rd row and column is rendered with very dark/heavy borders

This makes the grid feel visually heavy and distracting

Required fix:

Make 3×3 sub-grid separators more subtle

Reduce border thickness and/or contrast

Maintain clear block separation without overpowering the UI

Outcome:

Clean, balanced, modern grid appearance

2️⃣ Hexadoku (16×16) – Grid Line Refinement

Same issue as Standard Sudoku:

4×4 sub-grid separators are too dark and dominant

Required fix:

Apply the same refined grid styling approach used for Standard Sudoku

Softer borders, consistent visual language

Ensure:

Hexadoku does not feel cluttered despite higher density

3️⃣ Diagonal Sudoku & Hyper Sudoku – Region Visibility

Current issue:

Special regions (diagonals / hyper boxes) are highlighted with colors that are too light

These regions are hard to see during actual gameplay

Required fix:

Increase contrast of these highlighted regions

Make them clearly visible at a glance

Keep highlights:

Subtle

Non-distracting

Consistent with overall UI

Must not interfere with:

Cell selection highlight

Error states

Hint indicators

4️⃣ Killer Sudoku – Cage Distinguishability

Current issues:

Cages are hard to visually distinguish

Dashed borders + cluttered layout reduce clarity

Required fix (preferred approach):

Give each cage a distinct, bold border color

Colors should:

Be clearly different from adjacent cages

Not be overly bright or distracting

Fit the app’s theme

Ensure:

Cage sum numbers remain readable

Styling does not conflict with selection, error, or hint states

Alternative acceptable enhancements:

Optional subtle background shading per cage

Solid or improved dashed borders if needed

5️⃣ Odd–Even Sudoku – Cell Color Contrast

Current issue:

Gray (odd) and blue (even) cell backgrounds are too light

Hard to distinguish during gameplay without opening the rules modal

Required fix:

Increase contrast of odd/even cell colors

Make restrictions immediately obvious from the grid

Ensure:

Numbers remain readable

Colors do not conflict with:

Selected cell highlight

Error/conflict states

Hint indicators

Visuals in the grid must match the explanation shown in the “How to Play” modal
