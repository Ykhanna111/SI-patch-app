Implement the following fixes and improvements carefully, ensuring clean UX, correct logic, and consistency across the app.

1️⃣ Profile Settings – Back Navigation Fix

In Profile Settings, replace the current “Back to Game” navigation.

It should instead say “Back to Sudoku Adventure”.

Clicking it must redirect the user to the Sudoku Adventure screen, not an active or previous game.

2️⃣ Remove Prefilled Demo Data (Register Page)

On the Create Account / Register page:

Remove all prefilled/example values such as:

First Name, Last Name

Username

Email

All input fields must be completely empty on initial load.

No demo values should be visible to the user.

Placeholders (if any) should be neutral (e.g., “Enter email”).

3️⃣ Remove Prefilled Username (Sign In Page)

On the Sign In page:

The username input must not contain any default or example value.

The field should always be empty on page load.

4️⃣ Login Using Username OR Email

Allow users to log in using either:

Username or

Email ID

Use a single input field and detect automatically whether the input is an email or username.

Authenticate accordingly without requiring the user to choose a mode.

5️⃣ Profile Settings – Email Rules

In Profile Settings:

Email must be mandatory, not optional.

Once an email is provided:

It should be auto-filled

Read-only / non-editable

Always displayed exactly as saved in the user’s profile

If a user somehow does not have an email yet:

Force them to add one before saving profile changes.

6️⃣ Daily Limit Handling (Guest Users)

Current incorrect behavior:

When a guest user exceeds the daily game limit, the app shows:
“Failed to create game”

Correct behavior:

Detect this as a daily limit exceeded case (not an error).

Show a clear message such as:

“Daily limit exceeded. Sign up to play more games.”

Display it as a toast, alert, or modal (not a system error).

Include a CTA to Sign Up / Create Account.

7️⃣ Remove Profile Picture from Profile Settings

Completely remove the Profile Picture section from Profile Settings:

Avatar / initials circle

“Choose Image” button

Image upload logic

Profile Settings should only contain:

First Name

Last Name

Username

Email

8️⃣ Username Validation & Security Constraints

Add strict username validation, similar to password rules:

Minimum length (e.g., 5–6 characters)

Maximum length (e.g., 20–30 characters)

Allowed characters:

Letters (a–z, A–Z)

Numbers (0–9)

_ and . only

No spaces

Cannot start or end with special characters

Must be unique

Show inline validation errors explaining exactly why a username is invalid.
