You are an expert QA tester, security specialist, and senior full-stack engineer. Your task is to thoroughly test my Sudoku application/website and ensure:

1. Functionality Testing

Verify all Sudoku variants (Classic, Killer, Samurai, X-Sudoku, Hyper-Sudoku, Jigsaw, etc.) work correctly.

Check all game modes, levels, timers, hints, error highlighting, and custom puzzles.

Solve multiple puzzles in each variant to ensure there are no logical inconsistencies, dead ends, or unsolvable puzzles.

Test auto-solver—ensure it follows valid Sudoku rules and supports every variant implemented.

2. Logic + Algorithm Testing

Make sure puzzle generation never creates invalid or multiple-solution puzzles.

Verify solving algorithms are correctly implemented.

Check no algorithm produces contradictions or breaks Sudoku constraints.

Validate edge cases: minimum clues, maximum clues, 16x16 grids, diagonal rules, killer cages, overlapping zones.

3. Implementation Error Testing

Test responsiveness on mobile/tablet/desktop.

Check UI/UX for any broken buttons, menus, or timers.

Test performance under load (fast switching, generating multiple puzzles).

Check for any runtime warnings or console errors.

Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast).

4. Security Testing

Ensure all code is properly wrapped/minified/obfuscated so it cannot be easily viewed after deployment.

Confirm no API keys, environment variables, or logic is exposed.

Add CSP (Content Security Policy) headers to prevent XSS attacks.

Add protections including:

XSS protection

CSRF protection

CSP & frame-ancestors

Referrer-Policy

Strict-Transport-Security

X-Content-Type-Options

Rate limiting for puzzle endpoint

Input sanitation on all user inputs

Ensure backend endpoints are protected, rate-limited, and sanitized.

5. Code Wrapping & Deployment Hardening

Minify, obfuscate, and bundle the final code so no source code is visible to users.

Ensure API logic is executed server-side, not client-side.

Hide implementation details and restrict access using best security practices.

Perform a final review to validate that no sensitive information is exposed.

6. Provide Output As:

Detailed bug report (functional + logical + security).

List of recommended fixes.

Final secure deployment checklist.”
